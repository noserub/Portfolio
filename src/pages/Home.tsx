# Research insights

## Users' true goal was discovery, not just social posting

They wanted to know what's good, and where to get it.

## In-app camera was a distraction

People preferred their phone's native camera or third-party apps.

## Businesses needed engagement beyond ads

They wanted a feedback loop with consumers.

## Reviews were the missing link

No app gave standardized, trustworthy cannabis product reviews.

## Avoid stereotypes

Users rejected "stoner" branding — they wanted something more professional and inclusive.

---

# Competitive analysis

## Leafly
Cannabis information and strain rating app
• No ability to rate products
• Strain ratings highly variable based on producer
• Limited social component

## Weedmaps
Cannabis dispensary locater
• Dispensary ratings
• No products ratings
• No social component

## Vivino
Wine ratings and reviews
• Individual wine ratings
• Wine maker ratings
• Social component

## Rex
Recommends places to visit
• Ratings for restaurants, parks, stores, etc.
• No ratings for products
• Product with limited social component

---

# The solution: A new direction

Armed with these insights, we rallied around a new vision: to become the go-to cannabis discovery engine. This meant a complete overhaul of the app's core functionality.

---

# Key features

## Streamlined Registration & Onboarding
We simplified the sign-up process and guided new users to content immediately relevant to their location and interests, reducing drop-off while maintaining compliance.

## Social-Driven Product Reviews
Our key differentiator: a powerful review system where users could share detailed product reviews with ratings and experiences, creating trust and authenticity.

## Intuitive Navigation System
Redesigned navigation to prioritize the most important features: local discovery, social feeds, and product reviews for seamless exploration.

## Robust Dispensary Finder
Built a comprehensive local dispensary finder with business profiles, menus, and user reviews—serving users while opening a new revenue stream for the business.

---

# Registration, onboarding and compliance

One important business problem we had to solve as a publicly traded company, was how might we serve people in legal cannabis markets without stepping out of compliance with recreational and medical marijuana legislation being passed at the state level?

• Simplified sign-up flow with geo-fencing for legal states only
• Dropped-off users reduced, compliance maintained
• Onboarding experience served as education for users

---

# Product reviews

There were a lot of opinions from research on establishing a more refined rating system for cannabis products. We explored many iterations and concepts to figure out what type of rating system to use for cannabis product reviews.

• Introduced 5-star review system (avoided weed-leaf icons)
• Supported tagging, product attributes, and dispensary linkage
• Standardized product descriptions (taste, smell, effects)

---

# Navigation, feeds, and business profiles

Since we were adding cannabis reviews to the platform, we wanted them to have visibility in the network. To address this we added a new feed that only focused on cannabis reviews.

• Redesigned nav to prioritize Discovery, Reviews, Local
• Separated feeds into:
  - **Following** (opt-in social)
  - **Reviews** (product info & ratings)
  - **Local** (nearby users & businesses)
  - **Global** (community-wide)
• Enhanced business profile design

---

# Dispensary finder

The dispensary finder was a solution to provide consumers access to the best products at local businesses, while also providing important consumer information about preferences and trends.

## Phase 1
• Geo-located dispensaries with color-coded medical vs recreational pins
• Business profiles with menus, reviews, and social feeds
• Monetization via premium placements, ads

## Phase 2
• Online ordering
• Rewards system
• Subscriptions

---

# Search, explore, and strain pages

The Explore experience needed to help us promote the dispensary finder, which was a new revenue stream for the company.

• Browse trending posts, search across users, hashtags, strains
• Strain/product pages tied to local dispensary listings
• Prominent location for the dispensary finder within Explore
• Positioned as the "Vivino for cannabis"

---

    caseStudyContent: `# Overview

Skype Qik was designed to reimagine video communication for a mobile-first era. As lead interaction designer and design lead on Skype's "Tiger Team", I created an entirely new interaction model for video messaging—one that felt spontaneous, lightweight, and expressive.

# The mission

Our mission was to create a mobile-first, modern video messaging app that removed barriers, encouraged self-expression, and aligned Skype with a new generation of users.

# At a glance

**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Windows Phone

**Role:** Lead Interaction Designer & Design Lead

**Timeline:** 0–1 launch project, exploratory fast-paced experiment over 6 months

**Team:** Led a "Tiger Team" of 7 designers, researchers, and multiple engineering teams across 3 mobile platforms

---

# The challenge

## The burden of traditional video calls

Skype's core product was designed for scheduled, synchronous video calls. But users—especially younger audiences—were moving toward instant, asynchronous platforms like Snapchat and Vine. Traditional calls felt awkward, heavy, and outdated:

* Scheduling friction created barriers
* Users wanted authentic, goofy, "in the moment" expression
* Calls lacked spontaneity, making video feel like a chore

## Challenge statement

How could Skype reinvent video communication to feel as effortless as a text message?

---

# My role & impact

## Leadership

* Led design for a cross-platform release (iOS, Android, Windows Phone)
* Produced a single, comprehensive design spec with platform-specific notes
* Shaped the vision for a lightweight, mobile-first interaction model

## Design & research

* Conducted generative research with younger demographics
* Identified desire for authentic, bite-sized video bursts over long calls
* Created a persistent camera viewfinder for zero-friction capture
* Designed an immersive, horizontal video timeline conversation model
* Introduced a new industry interaction model, later validated by competitors like Marco Polo

## Impact

* Delivered a fast, expressive app experience that influenced Microsoft's product roadmap
* Advanced professional growth as a design leader and innovator in real-time communication responsible for a product launch across multiple operating systems

# Impact

🚀 **First mobile app released by Skype** beyond its main client

🧩 **Functionality integrated into Skype** after Qik was sunsetted

🌍 **Pioneered a new asynchronous video conversation design pattern**

📈 **Model later adopted by other apps**, including Marco Polo

---

# Research insights

## Spontaneity drives authenticity

Users wanted quick, goofy clips—not scheduled video calls

## Always-ready camera reduces friction

A persistent viewfinder was essential for capturing real moments

## Clips create emotional response

Small, asynchronous bursts encouraged playful communication

## Lightweight > complex

Removing feeds and clutter kept focus on the conversation itself

---

# Competitive analysis

## Snapchat

Fun, disappearing messages, but ephemeral focus limited deeper conversations

## Vine

Great for creative clips, but not designed for back-and-forth interaction

## Periscope

Good for streaming and broadcasting video, but lacks the personality of 1-1 or small group interaction.

## Skype Qik

Positioned as a hybrid—personal, asynchronous video conversations designed for immediacy and expression

---

# The solution: Building a new kind of conversation

To bring the vision to life, I anchored the design in three principles:

## Zero-friction recording

* Persistent viewfinder enabled instant capture
* Removed steps between opening the app and recording

## Immersive conversation model

* Flexible, expressive interaction
* Horizontal timeline of clips created a dynamic, living thread
* Enabled fast back-and-forth, emotional interaction

This design innovation was so powerful that it has since been adopted and popularized by other successful apps, most notably Marco Polo.

## Lightweight UI

* Stripped away clutter and feeds
* Conversations became the center of the experience

---

# Design

## Top level / default view

We wanted the structure to be very lightweight and simple. We didn't want a social feed or other features that distract from the primary goal of direct communication.

We wanted to leverage gestures to invoke the record state.

* Flick it down, the camera appears.
* Flick it up to scroll recent conversations.
* Tap on a conversation to view the video messages

The core screens include a top level view where video conversations are visible, a recording screen to capture the video, a conversation view to playback individual videos within the conversation.

## Conversation view

For the conversation view, we considered a video timeline rather than a traditional vertically scrolling chat.

We tested both models and as it turned out, the horizontal video timeline model was also a great way of allowing the UI to be more conversational by allowing it be viewed like a movie.

We decided on using the horizontal video timeline model for the conversation view because it was a more engaging experience with less transitions and more focus on content.

## Recording

The camera / recording interface can be invoked by tapping on the affordance at the top of the view, or by using the swipe down gesture.

The camera used a countdown timer to indicate how much time is available for each video message.

---

# Business and consumer impact

## Consumer

✅ Delivered a new, expressive way to connect asynchronously

✅ Removed the "awkwardness" of traditional video calls

✅ Encouraged playful, authentic communication

## Business

✅ Positioned Skype as an innovator in mobile-first design

✅ Provided critical learnings about spontaneous video adoption

✅ Qik's features were integrated into the broader Skype ecosystem

## Industry

✅ Established the asynchronous video conversation model and design pattern later adopted by apps like Marco Polo

✅ Validated the market need for lightweight, expressive video messaging

---

# Key takeaways

Skype Qik proved that video could be as spontaneous and effortless as texting.

The asynchronous conversation model my team designed reshaped how people thought about video messaging.

Designed for 3 platforms at once with a quick pace and successful product launch

I pioneered an interaction pattern that has since become standard across the industry.`,
