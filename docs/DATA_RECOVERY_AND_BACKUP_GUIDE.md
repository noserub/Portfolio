# Data Recovery & Backup Guide

## üö® What Happened: Data Loss After Figma Make Restart

When Figma Make reboots or refreshes, your data stored in **localStorage** can sometimes be cleared depending on the browser/environment. This is a known limitation of browser-based storage.

---

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. **Auto-Initialize with Sample Data**
- When no case studies exist, the app now automatically creates a **Sample Case Study**
- This sample includes:
  - ‚úÖ **4 placeholder images** in Project Images gallery
  - ‚úÖ **2 placeholder images** in Flow Diagrams gallery
  - ‚úÖ **Template markdown content** for all sections

### 2. **Welcome Message**
- On first load, you'll see a welcome dialog explaining the sample case study
- Option to sign in immediately to start editing

### 3. **Placeholder Image System**
- Placeholder images show as **colorful gradient backgrounds with camera icons**
- These are temporary and meant for testing the gallery UI
- They will disappear on page reload (this is expected behavior in Placeholder Mode)

## üíæ CRITICAL: How to Prevent Data Loss

### **The Golden Rule: EXPORT FREQUENTLY!**

Since Figma Make uses browser localStorage (which can be cleared), you MUST export your data regularly.

### **Export Workflow:**

1. **After Making Changes:**
   - Wait for "‚úÖ Changes Saved to localStorage!" message
   - Click **"üì• Export Now"** button (top right in Edit Mode or Preview Mode)
   - Save the JSON file with a descriptive name: `portfolio-2025-01-07-v1.json`

2. **Save Multiple Versions:**
   ```
   portfolio-2025-01-07-morning.json
   portfolio-2025-01-07-afternoon.json
   portfolio-2025-01-07-final.json
   ```

3. **Keep Backups:**
   - Save to your computer
   - Email to yourself
   - Save to cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

## üîÑ How to Recover Lost Data

### **Option 1: Import from Backup** ‚úÖ (Recommended)

1. Click **"üì§ Import"** button (top right)
2. Select your most recent `.json` export file
3. Confirm the import
4. Page will reload with your data restored

### **Option 2: Start Fresh**

If you have no backup:
1. The app auto-creates a **Sample Case Study** with placeholder images
2. Sign in (password: `brian2025`)
3. Switch to Edit Mode
4. Create your content from scratch
5. **EXPORT IMMEDIATELY!**

## üñºÔ∏è About Placeholder Images

### **What They Are:**
- Colorful gradient backgrounds (pink ‚Üí purple ‚Üí blue ‚Üí cyan ‚Üí yellow)
- White camera icon (80√ó80px) centered
- URLs like `blob:placeholder-1`, `blob:placeholder-2`, etc.

### **Why They Exist:**
- **Testing Mode** - Test gallery features without using storage
- **Pre-Supabase** - Placeholder until you integrate Supabase for permanent image storage
- **Zero Storage** - Don't save to localStorage (keeps exports small)

### **How They Work:**
1. **New case study created** ‚Üí Gets 4 + 2 placeholder images automatically
2. **Upload real image** ‚Üí Replaces placeholder (creates blob URL)
3. **Page reload** ‚Üí Blob URLs expire ‚Üí Placeholder camera icon shows
4. **Export** ‚Üí Placeholder images are NOT included in export (by design)

### **When to Upload Real Images:**
- **NOT NOW** - Placeholder mode is for testing
- **LATER** - When you integrate Supabase or external image hosting
- **WHY?** - Blob URLs are temporary and will disappear on reload

## ‚úÖ Summary

**MOST IMPORTANT:**
- üì• **EXPORT FREQUENTLY** - After every editing session
- üíæ **KEEP BACKUPS** - Multiple versions in safe places
