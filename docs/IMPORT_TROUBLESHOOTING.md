4. Review the diagnostic output
5. Type: `window.autoRepair()` to fix issues
6. Reload the page

### Option 3: Recovery Mode
1. Add `?recovery=true` to your URL
   - Example: `https://your-site.com/?recovery=true`

## üìä Understanding the Diagnostic Tools

### Pre-React Loading Indicator
When you reload the page, you should see:
- A loading spinner
- Status messages like "Checking localStorage...", "Validating imported data..."
- If the page takes more than 10 seconds to load, you'll see an error with recovery options

### Full Diagnostics Report
Run `window.runDiagnostics()` in the console to see:
- ‚úÖ localStorage accessibility
- üì¶ Total storage used
- üîç Validation of each data item (case studies, design projects, hero text)
- ‚ùå List of any corruption issues found
- üìã Detailed structure of your data

### Auto-Repair Function
Run `window.autoRepair()` in the console to:
- Automatically detect corrupted data
- Remove invalid JSON
- Remove data that's not in the expected format
- Preserve all valid data

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Import successful" message but no data visible
**Cause:** You were signed out during import, so you can't see the edit mode content.

**Solution:**
1. Sign in using the overflow menu (‚ãÆ) or theme toggle button
2. The password is: `brian2025`
3. Your imported data will now be visible

### Issue: Blank screen immediately after import
**Cause:** Data corruption or invalid JSON format.

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for red error messages
3. Run `window.autoRepair()`
4. Reload the page

### Issue: "localStorage verification failed after write"
**Cause:** Browser security settings or storage quota exceeded.

**Solution:**
1. Check your browser's storage settings
2. Clear some data to free up space
3. Try importing a smaller JSON file
4. Check if your browser allows localStorage for this site

### Issue: Import seems to hang/freeze
**Cause:** Very large JSON file or slow browser.

**Solution:**
1. Wait for the pre-React loader to show an error (max 10 seconds)
2. Use Recovery Mode: add `?recovery=true` to URL
3. Try importing smaller chunks of data

## üîç Step-by-Step Import Process

Here's what happens when you import:

1. **You click "Import"** ‚Üí File dialog opens
2. **You select a JSON file** ‚Üí File is read
3. **JSON is parsed** ‚Üí Validates format
4. **Data is validated** ‚Üí Checks arrays, objects, structure
5. **Data is written to localStorage** ‚Üí Immediate verification
6. **Page reloads** ‚Üí Fresh start with new data
7. **Pre-React checks run** ‚Üí Validates data before React loads
8. **React mounts** ‚Üí App renders with new data
9. **Success indicator shows** ‚Üí Green notification for 8 seconds

At each step, detailed logs are written to the browser console. Open DevTools (F12) to see them.

1. ‚è≥ Wait for the confirmation dialog
2. ‚è≥ Wait for the "Import complete - reloading" message in console
